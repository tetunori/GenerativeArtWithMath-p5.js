**Figure 1.6** :  
`numA = 12, numB = 17`  
=>  
`numA = 17, numB = 12`  

## 1-2. P.064
The figure of the case `thr = 320` seems to be wrong and a correct figure is like below.

### 1-3-1. divRect.pde::Line 9
To be accurate, this comparison needs to take the round-off error into accont as Line 12 or 18.  
So, change as  
`while (wd > thr){`  
=>  
`while (wd > thr + 0.1){`  
or normalize `wd` before this comparison.

Interestingly, this fix causes the change of Figure 1.10 case `thr = 40`.
I think both images are beautiful so I don't think this issue has to be fixedðŸ˜‰. 

### 1-3-2. mouseClicked.pde::Line 9
`ratio = (float) numA / numB;`  
=>  
`ratio = (float) numB / numA;`

## 1-4. Ch1_Euclid::RecurDivSquareGUI
### divSq.pde::Line 9
Same as 1-3-1.
